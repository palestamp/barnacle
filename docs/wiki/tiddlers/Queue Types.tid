type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

!! Reliable FIFO
Classic First-In-First-Out queue.

!!! Use cases

* Processing messages in order. This use case often curry a lot of load in terms of messages count per second. Postgres wonâ€™t be a good solution for such workloads.

!!! Interface

```go
type FIFO interface {
	Push(msg Message) error
	Pop(count int) ([]Message, error)
	Ack(mid MessageID) error
}
```

!! Delayed Queue
Queue that holds messages invisible until some deadline. Delayed Queue is a supertype of FIFO Queue and a sibling of Priority Queue (PQ has discrete buckets, DQ has continuous buckets). FIFO can be implemented as DQ with constant 0 visibility timeout.

!!! Use cases
* Periodic Jobs (delayed queue provides opportunity to create periodic tasks)
* Jobs scheduled to be executed at some specific time.
